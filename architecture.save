In this code I want to do this: 

1. Look at each collection description 
2. Match which collection fits the best(1st API Call) 
3. Give the schema of only that collection to the LLM 
4. The LLM returns a query based on that schema(2nd API Call)
5. The query is executed 
6. Based on the results, the the LLM generates the result in a user friendly way(3rd API call) 





The previous code has: 

1. Looks at the entire schema 
2. Decides which collection to execute the query on
3. Executes the query on that collection
